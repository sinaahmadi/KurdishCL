<!-- {{ site.description }} -->

This course provides an overview of the field of computational linguistics. The goal of the field is to build technologies that will allow machines to understand human langauges. Applications include spell checking, machine translation, morphological analysis and syntactic parsing. <br>

There is currently not much content on computational linguistics and natural language processing in <b>Kurdish</b>. A primarily goal is to introduce this important field to the Kurdish public, particularly Kurdish linguists, developers and also, students who are interested in such topics. This will hopefully help the community to play a more active role in creating technologies for Kurdish, which is currently a less-resourced language. <br>

This course is fully organized online. Each topic is taught in a video which is uploaded on YouTube (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEnbUkiYHKxTvAeNRTVhxIQ" target="_blank">link to the channel</a>). It is important to note that this course is completely free.
